# L298N Arduino Motors Driver Library

An Open Source library for Arduino and the L298N driver module.

## Important Information

Wiring is essential for the library to work properly, so please be sure to connect your motors in the right way or the methods can doesn't work as expected.

## Installation

Download this repository as a .zip file, or [click this](https://github.com/imTDB/Arduino-L298N/archive/master.zip) to download it directly. Then go to the Arduino IDE, once there go to `Sketch -> Include library -> Add .ZIP Library` to have it ready to use.


## Usage

Use `#include <L298N.h>` to add the library to your project.

| Method | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `L298N()` | Constructor. Put the parameters in this order, `(int IN1, int IN2, int IN3, int IN4)` |
| `moveBackwards()` | Moves the motors in backwards direction. |
| `moveForward()` | Moves the motors in forward direction. |
| `moveRight()` | Moves the motors to turn right. |
| `moveLeft()` | Moves the motors to turn left. |
| `stop()` | Stop all the motors. |
| `check()` | If the library is currently working returns 1 (Just for debugging purposes). |

## Examples

| Method | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| [basic_movement](https://github.com/imTDB/Arduino-L298N/tree/master/examples/basic_movement) | Moves the motors in all available directions. |
| [simple_check](https://github.com/imTDB/Arduino-L298N/tree/master/examples/bluetooth_movement) | Checks if the library is working without any wiring. |
| [bluetooth_movement](https://github.com/imTDB/Arduino-L298N/tree/master/examples/simple_check) | Use a Bluetooth App to move the motors. |
